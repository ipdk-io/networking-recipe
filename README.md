# P4 Control Plane

This repository is the superproject for P4 Control Plane.
It is the successor to P4-OVS.

- also called the IPDK Networking Recipe
- formerly known as P4-OVS Split Architecture

See the [Overview](https://ipdk.io/p4cp-userguide/overview/overview.html)
section of the User Guide for a description of its components.

The Networking Recipe now supports version 3 of the ES2K Linux Networking
P4 Program. Support for version 2 has been discontinued.

### `ovs-p4rt` interface

The public functions in the ovs-p4rt API have been renamed to make them
more consistent with C programming conventions.

The documentation files have moved from the `docs` directory to the
<https://github.com/ipdk-io/p4cp-userguide> repository.

### `setup` directory

The Stratum dependencies have moved from the `setup` directory
