# P4 Control Plane

This repository is the superproject for P4 Control Plane.
It is the successor to P4-OVS.

- also called the IPDK Networking Recipe
- formally known as P4-OVS Split Architecture

P4 Control Plane modularizes P4-OVS and reduces coupling between its
components, making the code easier to maintain and more suitable for
upstreaming.

It moves the P4-specific components of the architecture from `ovs-vswitchd`
to a separate process called `infrap4d`.

## Upcoming changes

The Stratum dependencies will be moving from the `setup` directory to
a separate `stratum-deps` repository towards the end of October 2023.

See the setup directory's [README file](setup/README.md) for more information.
