=================
make-cross-ovs.sh
=================

Helper script to cross-compile and install Open vSwitch for the Arm Compute
Complex (ACC) of the IntelÂ® IPU E2100.

Build flow
==========

Building and installing OVS is the first step in building P4 Control Plane
for the IPU E2100.

.. image:: make-cross-ovs-flow.png

Once OVS is built, you can use the ``config-cross-recipe.sh`` script to
configure the next stage of the build, and the ``cmake`` command to compete it.

Syntax
======

.. code-block:: text

  ./scripts/es2k/make-cross-ovs.sh \
      [--help|-h]  \
      [--dry-run|-n] \
      [--build=BLDDIR | -B BLDDIR] \
      [--prefix=PREFIX | -P PREFIX] \
      [--toolchain=TOOLFILE | -T TOOLFILE ] \
      [--jobs=NJOBS | -j NJOBS]
