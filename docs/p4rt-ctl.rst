Using networking-recipe clients executables for P4 support
==========================================================

This document describes how to use executables generated by networking-recipe
for supporting P4 programs.

- For code clone and build instructions refer to ``README.build.md``.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before using executables generated by networking-recipe for P4 programming, user should
have a valid P4 file and generated dependent files using P4 compiler for the specific target.

Dependent generated files for a sample.p4 file::

    $ sample.conf, p4info.txt, bf-rt.json, pipe/context.json, pipe/sample.spec


P4 DPDK backend supports both PSA and PNA architectures.
Based on the architecture used in the P4 program, P4 compiler emits the pipeline name differently.
If P4 program is defined for

     - PNA architecture, P4 compiler emits the PIPELINE name as "pipe" irrespective of the
       name defined in the P4 program.
     - PSA architecture, P4 compiler uses and emits the PIPELINE name defined by the user in the program.
       Currently it supports only ingress pipelines.

This pipeline name is referred in below three places and consumed by P4-OVS to program the target.
    a) 'p4_pipeline_name' in /usr/share/stratum/target_skip_p4_no_bsp.conf file.
    b) 'p4_pipeline_name' in sample.conf file.

Networking recipe assumes pipeline name is defaulted to "pipe".
If the P4 program is defined for PSA architecture and uses a pipeline name other than "pipe", we need
to manually change the 'pipeline name' at all the above places to the ingress pipeline name mentioned
in the p4 file.

Hence to avoid this handcrafting, we recommend using the ingress pipeline name as "pipe" for all the
PSA programs.

tdi_pipeline_builder executable
-------------------------------

tdi_pipeline_builder is an executable generated when networking-recipe is built and this
executable is used to generate a protobuf based bin file. This pb.bin contains information
of bfrt-config, context and config which are extracted from sample.conf which is generated
via p4c compiler as mentioned above.

Generate ``pb.bin``::

    $ tdi_pipeline_builder --p4c_conf_file=<path-to-input-sample-file.conf> \
        --bf_pipeline_config_binary_file=<path-to-output-file.pb.bin>
    $ Example: \
        tdi_pipeline_builder --p4c_conf_file=/home/mydir/sample.conf \
            --bf_pipeline_config_binary_file=/home/mydir/sample.pb.bin

.. important::

    Here we need to execute this command from the parent directory of
    relative paths mentioned in bfrt-config/context/config parameters
    of sample.conf


p4rt-ctl executable
--------------------

p4rt-ctl is an executable generated when networking-recipe is built and this executable
is a P4Runtime client which connects to P4Runtime server running in Stratum via gRPC for
enabling P4Runtime capabilities.

Each CLI command connects to gRPC ports opened by server, send a protobuf based
message. Refer to p4runtime.proto for more details on type of messages and
services that are available for a p4runtime client.

1. Set a forwarding pipeline::

    $ p4rt-ctl set-pipe SWITCH PROGRAM P4INFO
    $ Example: p4rt-ctl set-pipe br0 <path>/sample.pb.bin <path>/p4info.txt

  .. note::

    ``SWITCH``: Refers to the bridge name, which maps to device name
    internally.
    ``PROGRAM``: Refers to protobuf binary file generated by
    tdi_pipeline_builder executable and the P4 program's configuration file.

    for a P4 program.

2. Get a forwarding pipeline::

    $ p4rt-ctl get-pipe SWITCH
    $ Example: p4rt-ctl set-pipe br0

  .. note::

    ``SWITCH``: Refers to the bridge name, which maps to device name
    internally.

3. Add a rule for a table into the forwarding pipeline::

    as well. 'priority' is a case sensitivity field expected from user.
    Mask for ternary or WCM match field is expected in x.x.x.x format for IPv4
    or an integer value or a hexa-decimal values.
    match_filed_key=value,priority=value,action=action_name(value)

    is expected in x.x.x.x format for IPv4 or an integer value or a
    hexa-decimal value. Format "match_filed_key=value,priority=value"

14. Get indirect counter entry value ::

    $ p4rt-ctl get-counter SWITCH COUNTER_TABLE COUNTER_FLOW
    $ Example: p4rt-ctl get-counter br0 ingress.ipv4_host_counter "counter_id=308545543,index=1"

    ``COUNTER_FLOW``: Refers to the counter ID (generated ID by p4c, refer to bfrt.json file)
    and the counter table index. Format "counter_id=<number>,index=<number>". A counter_id=0
    will display value for all counters added up. For index=UNSET, all cells for specified
    counter_id will be displayed.

15. Reset indirect counter entry value ::

    $ p4rt-ctl reset-counter SWITCH COUNTER_TABLE COUNTER_FLOW
    $ Example: p4rt-ctl reset-counter br0 ingress.ipv4_host_counter "counter_id=308545543,index=1"

    ``COUNTER_FLOW``: Refers to the counter ID (generated ID by p4c, refer to bfrt.json file)
    and the counter table index. Format "counter_id=<number>,index=<number>"

Known Issues
-------------

    1) SWITCH parameter specified in ``p4rt-ctl`` commands are not really
    utilized in current releases. It accepts any kind of value

    2) counter_id=0 in ``p4rt-ctl get-counters`` for indirect counters
    is not supported in current release. Flow counters index=unset or index=0
    does not give cumulative byte count.

    3) Runtime validation of ``value`` for each key in ``p4rt-ctl`` is not supported.
