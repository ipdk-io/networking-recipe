# Source Files for the P4 Control Plane User Guide

The files in this directory are used to build the
[P4 Control Plane User Guide](https://ipdk.io/p4cp-userguide/).

You can view the source files individually, but the internal links are
relative to the root of the user guide. Many of them won't work correctly
outside the context of the finished document.

We recommend that you access the User Guide through the link above.

There are also links to the User Guide on the main page of the
[networking-recipe repository](https://github.com/ipdk-io/networking-recipe)
(upper right-corner, in the **About** section), and under _Documentation_
in the [README file](https://github.com/ipdk-io/networking-recipe#readme).
