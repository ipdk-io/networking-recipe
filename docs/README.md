# Source Files for the P4 Control Plane User Guide

The files in this directory are used to build the
[P4 Control Plane User Guide](https://ipdk.io/p4cp-userguide/).

They can be read individually, but the internal links are relative to the
root of the user guide and won't work correctly if you're not browsing the
user guide itself.

We recommend that you use the link above to read the User Guide itself.

There are also links to it on the main page of the
[networking-recipe repository](https://github.com/ipdk-io/networking-recipe)
(upper right-corner, in the **About** section), and under _Documentation_
in the [README file](https://github.com/ipdk-io/networking-recipe#readme).
