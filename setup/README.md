# We've Moved!
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD026 -->

The Stratum dependencies have formally moved from the `setup` directory
to a new <https://github.com/ipdk-io/stratum-deps> repository.

This change allows the dependencies to be downloaded and built independently
of the Networking Recipe (P4 Control Plane).
It also makes them easier to maintain.

See the [README file](https://github.com/ipdk-io/stratum-deps/blob/main/README.md)
and
[Transition Guide](https://github.com/ipdk-io/stratum-deps/blob/main/docs/transition-guide.md)
in the `stratum-deps` repository for more information.
